# Lab-04: Explore identity governance in Azure AD with Privileged Identity management

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will explore some of the basic functionality of Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM does require Microsoft Entra ID P2 license.  In this lab, you, as the admin, will configure one of your users, Diego Siciliani, with an Azure AD user administrator role, through Privileged ID management (PIM).   With user admin privileges, Diego will be able to create users and groups manage licenses and more. Both the admin and the user, Diego, must be configured for the Microsoft Entra ID P2 license.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Reset the password for the user
+ Task 2: Assign an Azure AD role in Privileged Identity Management
+ Task 3: Sign in to the Microsoft Entra Admin Center to access the Privileged Identity Management

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Task 1: Reset the password for the user

In this task, you, as the admin, will reset the password for the user Diego Siciliani. This step is needed so you can initially sign in as the user in subsequent tasks.
 
1. Open Microsoft Edge, and in the address bar, enter **https://entra.microsoft.com**.
   
1. On **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** blade, you will see a login screen, in that enter the following email/username and then click on **Next**. 

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   
1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.

   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
   
1. From the left navigation panel, expand **Identity**, expand **Users**, then select **All users**.  

1. Select **Diego Siciliani** from the list of users.

1. Select **Reset password** from the top of the page. Since you haven't previously signed in as Diego, you don’t know his password, and will need to reset the password.

1. When the password reset window opens, select **Reset Password** and copy the password.

   >**Note**: Kindly make a note of the new password, as you will need it in a subsequent task, to be able to sign in as the user.
           
1. From the left navigation panel, select **Home** to return the home page for the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Keep the browser page open, as you will in the subsequent tasks.

## Task 2: Assign an Azure AD role in Privileged Identity Management

In this task, you, as the admin, will assign Diego an Azure AD role in Privileged Identity Management.

1. Open the browser tab for the home page of the Microsoft Entra admin center.  

1. From the left navigation panel, under "Identity", expand **Identity Governance**, then select **Privileged Identity Management**, and in the Get started page, select **Manage** under Manage access.

1. In the Assignment end fields, change the date to today’s date (note the default setting is one year from today, so you need to change the year). For the time, set the time to two hours from the current time.  After you have set the time field for the time when the Assignment ends, press the tab key on your keyboard and select **Assign** at the bottom of the page.

1. From the top of the page, select **Settings**.

1. In the Role setting details for the User Administrator, notice the different options.  Note that the setting to “Require justification on activation” is set to yes, and “On activation, require Azure MFA” is also set.  You will see both of these in the next task when Diego activates the role.  Also, note that “Require approval to activate” is set to No.  Leave all the settings to their default values.  Close the page by selecting the **X** on the top right corner of the screen.
